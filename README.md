### Behold!

This repository contains all the material and source-codes used in the workshop **"Neural Networks - A Practical Introduction"**, ministered at the **XII Semana Acadêmica da Computação - UFC (Brazil)**. 

This is a 4-hour workshop focused on teaching how to develop a Neural Network from scratch, without aid of higher-level Machine Learning libraries. The goal is to promote better understanding about how these classical shallow Neural Networks works, while still giving a practical experience of how to implement and use these architectures for a simple application in _Computer Vision_.

This workshop is destined to beginners in fields such as Machine Learning, Data Science, Statistics or any related field. To understand the material, it is _desirable to know basic Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics_. If you know how to program in any language, you're also good to go (Python is very intuitive :P ). 

In case of any doubts, suggestions, or if you want to send me dog pictures, please contact: [minhotmog@gmail.com](#mail-to:minhotmog@gmail.com)

Bons estudos! :)
